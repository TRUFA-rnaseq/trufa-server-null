#+STARTUP: showall

TRUFA (Transcriptomes User-Friendly Analysis) is a free webserver designed to
help you perform RNA-seq analysis.

Joint work done by:

 - Advanced Computing & e-Science Research Line at Instituto de FÃ­sica de
   Cantabria (IFCA)
 - Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales

This package contains the server side tools and scripts used by the TRUFA web
frontend.

This null version is intended as mocked library to test TRUFA web and no real
workflows are done.
